# Minority_Action_Project

The Minority Action Project is a research project designed to identify the resources available for
minority-led startups in innovative cities in the United States. The objective is to determine what factors contribute to the
success of minority-led tech companies in innovative cities. We looked specifically at Boston as an
example of a typical innovative city in the United States. 


The specific objectives of this project are the following:
1. Determine the distribution of businesses and resources in Boston to gain insight into the distribution of
businesses and resources in a typical innovative American city

2. Obtain statistics on various demographics such as ethnicity, income, gender, sex, occupation, and
education level of entrepreneurs throughout the United States.

3. Measure the change in entrepreneurial growth throughout the years in the U.S. Does growth or decline
match minority entrepreneurial growth/decline?

4. Identify a metric for entrepreneurial success given the datasets provided. What are the variables that
contribute to success in a business? Does ethnic/gender data correlate with these definitions?
